## Features
- Randomized math problems: The app generates random math problems based on the user's chosen settings.
- Operation selection: Users can select the type of operation they want to practice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- An adjustable number of digits: Users can choose the number of digits in the math problems to match their skill level.
- Score tracking: The app keeps track of the user's score, displaying the number of correct and incorrect answers.
- Time-based challenges: Users can test their speed by solving as many math problems as possible within a specific time limit.

- "It still needs an improved design and scoring system"
